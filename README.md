# Text Data Analysis

## Project Overview

Welcome to our honours assignment on text data analysis. This assignment was completed by myself and two other honours students. This repo aims to show my experience with R, text analysis, topic modelling and sentiment analysis. This assignment involved using text data about research in the Information Systems field over 10 years to extract meaningful insights and essentially answer the question: what is information systems?. This was achieved through collaboration and various  text analysis techniques. This assignment was initially completed in RStudio using a Quarto notebook.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the following important files and folders:

- **_extensions/nrennie/PrettyPDF/:** Directory containing formatting extensions for PDF generation.
- **data/:** Directory containing raw text data files used in the analysis.
- **images/:** Directory containing images used in the report.
- **Analysis Notebook.qmd:** Quarto markdown file containing the code and documentation for the text analysis.
- **Assignment 3.Rproj:** RStudio project file for the assignment.
- **Information Systems Research Report.qmd:** Quarto markdown file for the final report.
- **Information-Systems-Research-Report.pdf:** PDF version of the final report presenting our analysis, findings and the insights.
- **hons_da_assignment_3_brief.pdf:** Project brief outlining the assignment requirements.

## Project Description

This project involves several key steps:

-   **Data Sourcing:** Finding useful data that could be used for meaningful analysis.
-   **Data Handling:** Reading and exploring the text data involves steps such as tokenizing, removing stop words, special characters, and punctuation, as well as creating document-term matrices (DTMs) and corpora.
-   **Topic Modeling:** Using algorithms to identify and extract topics from the research articles titles, key words and abstracts.
-   **Sentiment Analysis:** Analysing the sentiment expressed in the research articles key words and abstracts.
-   **Data Visualisation:** Displaying the results of exploration, topic modelling and sentiment analysis.
-   **Report Writing:** Interpreting the code and outputs. Presenting our findings in a meaningful format.

### Notes on this repo

This assignment was uploaded as a representation of my text analysis, topic modelling and sentiment analysis skills in R at the time. All data sources used are publicly available.

This assignment was completed on 17 May 2024 as part of the Stellenbosch University Bachelor of Informatics Honours program, by myself and two classmates.
